# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This repository contains an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that work together to create a work day scheduler. The work day scheduler allows the user to enter in plans, meetings, or any important information they may need throughout their work day. The day and date of the week is conviently displayed at the top of the schedule so the user always knows what day they are planning for. There are time slots from 9am to 5pm and each slot has a save button so the user can save their input. When the user revisits the scheduler throughout the day, any saved inputs wil be displayed in their correct time slot. Furthermore, the time slots are color coded depending on the time of day. If the time slot is in the past it will display as grey, the present displays as red, and the future as green.
